In order to decide, to which city we are moving, there are plenties of factors to be accouted into consideration. One important aspect is, what kinds of venues are the most in each city. This could indirectly describe the cities. Someone who enjoy delicious food would rather choose a city, where there are many restaurants, while others who live a night life prefer a city with more pubs. This project aims at top 80 German cities in the term of populations and explore the cities in respect to venues . However it's quite time consuming if sometone lists all the venues for each city and summarize the data manuelly. As a data scientist I use Foursqare API to explore the top 50 venues including their categories for each city, afterwards I would take the information of the top 50 venues as features of every city and apply cluster analyse on these cities. This should reveals which cities are similar with each other, and which cities are quite different when it comes to nearby venues. The target group of this project is anyone, who tends to move to a German city and needs advice to narrow down their choices. To get a better view, some example venue categories as listed as follows:\n\n   * Hotel\n   * Cafe\n   * Bar\n   * Restaurant\n   * Speakeasy\n   * Historic sites\n   * Garden"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data Description\nA list of needed data for this project:\n\n   * List of City Name\n   * List of City Latitude\n   * List of City Lontitude\n   * Group of Venues in each cities\n   * Categories of every venue\n   \nAs described in the section \"Problem and Background\", this notebook explore the top 80 German cities with the most populations. These cities can be founded directly in the wikipedia site: *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population*. Unfortunately, the table found in the wikipedia site does not provide any information about the geographical coordinates of each city. This problem can be solved by introducing the python library **geopy**, which can be used to locate every city. With geopy, we can easily map the cities into geographical coordinates. Now we use FourSquare API to explore each city, providing the geographical coordinates from the previous step. However, not all details of the venues matters in this project. In the phase of data preparation, we need extract the interesting information and transform them into the correct format. The most important information of each venue is the cities they belong to and their categories: Are they restaurants, bars or historic sites? Afterwards we can summarize the information for each city, and get the frequency of every venue category in the each city. At the last, the frequency table can be used to do the cluster analyse, which helps us to see the similarities between the cities. The result of the clustering will be visualized with **folium** map."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
